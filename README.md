# Covid-19-Avoid-Area

**Overview**

> This application was developed to monitor the density of COVID-19 cases by county as well as to give the user resources for the pandemic. Along with an interactive map of active cases, we have supplied a COVID-19 testing location finder, recent top peer reviewed articles related to the virus as well as a link to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) homepage. This application is meant to be your hub for information about the Coronavirus pandemic.

**Collaborators**

> Patrick Ceriale (github.com/PatCeriale), DeVon DeVaughn (github.com/DevonDeVaughnn), Joshua Jainga (github.com/jjainga), Kayla Newlon (github.com/kbnewlon),and Hilary Valencia Walsh (github.com/hilaryvalenciawalsh)

**Deployment**

> To deploy this application, launch the url in browser. The information displayed on the homepage will update regularly to give the user an up-to-date analysis of the COVID-19 density, confirmed cases, confirmed deaths, confirmed recoveries, as well as peer-reviewed articles related to the virus. If the user finds an article interesting, they may save it for later viewing and access it on the "My Resources" tab in the navbar at the top of the page. By clicking on the "Testing Centers" button, the user can find testing centers by state, and save the information to their "My Resources" tab. Accessed by clicking the "CDC Info" button, we have included some excerpts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage regarding the virus, as well as a link to their webpage.

**Technologies**

> This application was made using HTML, CSS, Pure CSS framework, JavaScript and jQuery. Data was sourced from Bing COVID-19 Data, Postman COVID-19 Testing Locations and Springer Nature API.

**Future Development**

> For future iterations of this application, the developers could integrate Google analytics and use them to let the user know what the population density is of a certain business or type of business (e.g. restaurant, grocery store, coffee shop, etc), allowing the user to judge whether it is a safe time to visit a public location.
